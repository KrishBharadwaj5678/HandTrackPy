# HandTrackPy

HandTrackPy is a Python script that uses computer vision to detect and track hands in real-time. This project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to provide efficient and accurate hand tracking for various applications like gesture recognition, virtual controls, and more.

## Features
- Real-time hand detection and tracking
- Multi-hand support
- Finger and palm landmark detection
- Lightweight and easy to integrate into projects
- Customizable for gesture-based applications

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## Usage
Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandTrackPy.git
cd HandTrackPy
python hand_track.py
```

## How It Works
The script utilizes **MediaPipe Hands**, a deep-learning-based solution for hand tracking, to detect and analyze hand landmarks in real-time.

## Example Output
Once you run the script, your webcam will open, and detected hands will be highlighted with key points and bounding boxes.
