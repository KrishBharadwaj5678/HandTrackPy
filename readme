# ✋ HandTrackPy

HandTrackPy is a  Python script that uses computer vision to detect and track hands in real-time. This project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to provide efficient and accurate hand tracking for various applications like gesture recognition, virtual controls, and more.

## ✨ Features
- 🎥 Real-time hand detection and tracking
- ✋ Multi-hand support
- ⏳ Displays FPS (Frames Per Second) for performance monitoring
- 🖐️ Finger and palm landmark detection
- ⚡ Lightweight and easy to integrate into projects
- 🛠️ Customizable for gesture-based applications

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You will also need the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe numpy
```

## 🚀 Usage
Clone the repository and run the script:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HandTrackPy.git
cd HandTrackPy
python hand_track.py
```

## 🛠️ How It Works
The script utilizes **MediaPipe Hands**, a deep-learning-based solution for hand tracking, to detect and analyze hand landmarks in real-time.

## 📸 Example Output
