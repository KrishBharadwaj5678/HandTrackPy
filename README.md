HandTrackPy is a Python script that uses computer vision to detect and track hands in real-time. This project leverages OpenCV and MediaPipe to provide efficient and accurate hand tracking for various applications like gesture recognition, virtual controls, and more.

## ✨ Features
- 🎥 Real-time hand detection and tracking
- ✋ Multi-hand support
- ⏳ Displays FPS (Frames Per Second) for performance monitoring
- 🖐️ Finger and palm landmark detection
- ⚡ Lightweight and easy to integrate into projects
- 🛠️ Customizable for gesture-based applications

## 📥 Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KrishBharadwaj5678/HandTrackPy.git
```

### Run the script
```bash
python app.py
```

## 🛠️ How It Works
The script utilizes **MediaPipe Hands**, a deep-learning-based solution for hand tracking, to detect and analyze hand landmarks in real-time.
